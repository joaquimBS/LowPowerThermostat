# Low Power Thermostat [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joaquimBS/LowPowerThermostat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joaquimBS/LowPowerThermostat)

Here are the code and schematics of a IoT enabled, low power Thermostat, based on a [Moteino](https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/moteino/) board. It has a build-in 868MHz radio to transmit information to a base station and, therefore, push data the cloud.

The thermostat itself works just as a switch to the heater control line; no AC supply is needed.

Key features:
- Current temperature set point and ON/OFF modes are configurable through an Android app. :-)
- Low power (idle current of ~25uA). No AC supply needed. Can run for months with 3xAAA, LiPo, etc.
- OLED screen as a HID.
- 3 modes of operation:
	- Turn the heater ON for a period of time.
	- After a period of time, turn the heater ON for another period of time.
	- Temperature set point with ~~a configurable~~ 1ÂºC hysteresis. 
- IoT enabled through another Arduino based device connected to the Internet.

TODO:
- Connect the Thermostat directly to the Internet, keeping a low power profile.
- Add an RTC in order to program the Thermostat based on week days, day time, etc.
